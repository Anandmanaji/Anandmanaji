💫 About Me
👋 Hello, I'm Anand Manaji
I'm a passionate Design Verification Engineer with hands-on experience in SystemVerilog, UVM, and RTL debugging. I enjoy building scalable, reusable testbenches and solving complex verification challenges across protocols like AXI, FIFO, and memory subsystems.

With a strong foundation in functional coverage, assertions, and CDC verification, I aim to ensure first-silicon success using industry-standard tools such as QuestaSim, VCS, and ModelSim.

🛠️ Technical Skills
Languages & Methodologies: SystemVerilog, Verilog, UVM, Functional Coverage, Assertions, CDC

Tools & Platforms: QuestaSim, Synopsys VCS, ModelSim, Gvim, EDA Playground

Scripting: Shell Scripting, Python (Basic)

Operating Systems: Linux, Windows

🚀 Projects
AXI Protocol Verification:
Built UVM testbench and achieved 90%+ functional coverage

FIFO Verification (Sync/Async):
Designed and verified FIFO in Verilog with CDC handling; ensured data integrity

Configurable Memory Design:
Developed a parametric memory module and verified both front-door and back-door access using assertions and waveforms

📚 Currently Focused On
📈 Coverage-driven verification and advanced UVM methodologies

🧠 Assertion-based verification and RTL debugging

🧩 Developing reusable verification components through real-time training at VLSIGuru
